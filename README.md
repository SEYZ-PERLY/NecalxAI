## How to Use Necalx

Necalx is designed to be incredibly simple to use and teach.

### 1. Quick Start

As soon as you open Necalx, it'll greet you with a message explaining how it works.

### 2. Teaching Necalx

Necalx's core function is learning. Use the `teach:` command to input new information.

**Format:**
`teach: your question -> your answer | keywords: keyword1, keyword2, ...`

**Concrete Example:**
`teach: What is your name? -> My name is **Necalx**! I'm a local AI. | keywords: your name, what's your name, who are you`

* `your question`: The main question or key phrase Necalx should respond to.
* `your answer`: The specific response Necalx will give when it recognizes the question or keywords.
* `keywords:`: A comma-separated list of keywords that'll also trigger the answer. This is crucial for Necalx to understand different ways of asking the same question.

### 3. Asking Necalx Questions

Once you've taught Necalx something, you can ask it the exact question you defined or use any of the associated keywords.

**Examples based on the above concrete example:**
* You type: `What is your name?`
* You type: `your name`
* You type: `who are you`

In all these cases, Necalx will respond: "My name is **Necalx**! I'm a local AI."

### 4. Clearing All Data

If you want to reset Necalx and erase all the information it has learned, use the "**Clear All Data**" button in the chat header. Be careful, this action is irreversible!
